The main difference is that this set of classes
* makes it possible to hook in totally different serialization formats for the generated queries.
* the parser has been expanded to also support
 * backslash escape chars
 * makes brace support is optional
 * properly implements fielded terms
 * make the parser itself is extensible.

This all might be merged back into ezcSearch eventually and needs unit testing etc.
I developed this to parse solr queries for resolutionfinder.org and construct queries against apache solr
